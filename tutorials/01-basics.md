# Tutorial 1: Cursor Basics 🌟

## Learning Objectives
- Master AI code completion
- Learn inline editing (Ctrl+K)  
- Use chat for code explanation
- Practice file navigation

## 🏗️ Project: Building Your First Webpage

Let's create a personal portfolio page while learning Cursor's basics.

### Try This #1: AI Code Completion

1. Create `project/index.html`
2. Type `<!DOCTYPE` and wait
3. Press `Tab` to accept Cursor's HTML5 suggestion
4. Continue typing `<html>` and watch Cursor predict the structure

**Challenge**: See how much of a complete HTML page Cursor can generate from minimal input.

### Try This #2: Inline Editing (Ctrl+K)

1. In your HTML file, highlight the `<title>` tag content
2. Press `Ctrl+K`
3. Type: "Make this title more professional and creative"
4. Watch Cursor rewrite it instantly

### Try This #3: Chat with Your Code (Ctrl+L)

1. Press `Ctrl+L` to open chat
2. Type: "@index.html Explain the structure of this HTML file"
3. Ask: "How can I make this page responsive?"
4. Request: "Add semantic HTML5 elements"

### Try This #4: Smart Suggestions

Create these files and watch Cursor's intelligent completions:

**In project/style.css:**
```css
/* Type this comment and see what Cursor suggests */
/* Modern card design with glass morphism effect */
```

**In project/script.js:**
```javascript
// Type this and let Cursor complete
// Function to animate elements on scroll
```

## 🎯 Mini Project: Portfolio Header

Use Cursor to help you build:
1. A navigation bar with smooth scrolling
2. A hero section with your name and title  
3. Responsive design that works on mobile
4. Subtle animations and hover effects

### Pro Tips:
- Type comments describing what you want, then let Cursor write the code
- Use `Ctrl+K` to refactor and improve existing code
- Ask Cursor to explain any code you don't understand

## 🏆 Challenge Complete!

You've learned:
- ✅ Tab completion for lightning-fast coding
- ✅ Ctrl+K for inline editing and improvements
- ✅ Ctrl+L for chatting about your code
- ✅ How Cursor understands context and intent
